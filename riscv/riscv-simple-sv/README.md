# riscv-simple-sv

This is a collection of simple RISC V (rv32i) cores for teaching purposes. They are written in a subset of SystemVerilog understood by [Yosys](http://www.clifford.at/yosys/), the open-source hardware synthesis framework, and [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator), an open-source Verilog to C++ compiler. The implementation is extremely simple, no bells and whistles, and it's modularized sensibly, so that schematics generated by synthesis tools are readable.

Three cores are currently implemented:
- single-cycle core (one instruction per cycle, separate instruction and data bus),
- multicycle core (multiple cycles per instruction, single memory bus, only one adder),
- pipelined core (five-stage pipeline).

The single-cycle core is adapted from [riscv-simple](https://github.com/arthurbeggs/riscv-simple). Code structure has been modified for readability, and several bugs have been fixed.

## Testing 

The cores are tested using [official unit tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests).
